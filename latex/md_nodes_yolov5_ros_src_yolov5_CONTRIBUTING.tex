To allow your work to be integrated as seamlessly as possible, we advise you to\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item ✅ Verify your PR is {\bfseries{up-\/to-\/date with upstream/master.}} If your PR is behind upstream/master an automatic \href{https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/.github/workflows/rebase.yml}{\texttt{ Git\+Hub Actions}} merge may be attempted by writing /rebase in a new comment, or by running the following code, replacing \textquotesingle{}feature\textquotesingle{} with the name of your local branch\+:

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git remote add upstream https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git}
\DoxyCodeLine{git fetch upstream}

\DoxyCodeLine{git merge upstream/master}
\DoxyCodeLine{git push -\/u origin -\/f}
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item ✅ Verify all Continuous Integration (CI) {\bfseries{checks are passing}}.
\item ✅ Reduce changes to the absolute {\bfseries{minimum}} required for your bug fix or feature addition. \+\_\+\char`\"{}\+It is not daily increase
  but daily decrease, hack away the unessential. The closer to the source, the less wastage there is.\char`\"{}\+\_\+ — Bruce Lee

If you spot a problem with Y\+O\+L\+Ov5 please submit a Bug Report!

For us to start investigating a possible problem we need to be able to reproduce it ourselves first. We\textquotesingle{}ve created a few short guidelines below to help users provide what we need in order to get started.

When asking a question, people will be better able to provide help if you provide {\bfseries{code}} that they can easily understand and use to {\bfseries{reproduce}} the problem. This is referred to by community members as creating a \href{https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example}{\texttt{ minimum reproducible example}}. Your code that reproduces the problem should be\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item ✅ {\bfseries{Minimal}} – Use as little code as possible that still produces the same problem
\item ✅ {\bfseries{Complete}} – Provide {\bfseries{all}} parts someone else needs to reproduce your problem in the question itself
\item ✅ {\bfseries{Reproducible}} – Test the code you\textquotesingle{}re about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem
\end{DoxyItemize}

In addition to the above requirements, for \href{https://ultralytics.com/}{\texttt{ Ultralytics}} to provide assistance your code should be\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item ✅ {\bfseries{Current}} – Verify that your code is up-\/to-\/date with current Git\+Hub \href{https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master}{\texttt{ master}}, and if necessary {\ttfamily git pull} or {\ttfamily git clone} a new copy to ensure your problem has not already been resolved by previous commits.
\item ✅ {\bfseries{Unmodified}} – Your problem must be reproducible without any modifications to the codebase in this repository. \href{https://ultralytics.com/}{\texttt{ Ultralytics}} does not provide support for custom code ⚠️.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you believe your problem meets all of the above criteria, please close this issue and raise a new one using the 🐛 $\ast$$\ast$ Bug Report$\ast$$\ast$ \href{https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/new/choose}{\texttt{ template}} and providing a \href{https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example}{\texttt{ minimum reproducible example}} to help us better understand and diagnose your problem.\hypertarget{md_nodes_yolov5_ros_src_yolov5_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysection{License}\label{md_nodes_yolov5_ros_src_yolov5_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md14}
